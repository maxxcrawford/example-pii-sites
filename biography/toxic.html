        <p>The Twitter account with S.’s name featured an image of a white woman’s face, which was recognizable to Zilla as the same person she once taught. The tweets frequently denigrated Zilla, Sinha, and Tan for being Asian: “Fat Indian bitch,” read one tweet, referencing Zilla by her first name in another tweet that day. “Squinty eyed retard with a cucktonut husband,” read another, referencing Sinha. “I like that alex is probably abusive to her,” read one tweet. “And all she has is Catherine to call her awesome. Live in hell bitch.”

</p>

<p>One tweet from April 16th, 2022, read: “Yo someone literally has to get rid of this faggot alex. Who the fuck cares if he’s got a brothel of Asian women ready to suck his dick.”</p>

<p>A month later, a post with an image of grisly murder in Game of Thrones and the words: “A crown for a king. Don’t we all just want to say goodbye to Alex.</p>

<p>And: “I would like for these professors to die.</p>

<p>A dark realization came over Sinha: “She calls for people to murder us. She says that she wants me raped,” Sinha told me. “She would pay money to watch us bleed to death.</p>

<p>“I wanna be put in a situation where they’re hanging off the side of a cliff about to fall to their deaths begging for mercy and I can step on their hands and say me first and then watch them fall to their deaths.”</p>
<p>“I want them to suffer.</p>

<p>“Reporting Asians for sexual harassment is a new hobby of mine.”</p>

<p>“They’re just racist Asian supremacists who stand with anyone and anything that even looks somewhat Asian and they don’t like white women and will abuse white women in the name of Asian nationalism.</p>


<p>“Someone needs to man the fuck up and tell these Asians to step down and stop abusing white women to assert their dominance they don’t have in the real world.</p>


<p>“If anyone thinks I wouldn’t beat the living shit out of this Asian chick until it was hospitalized and I was arrested for assault well then you’re delusional.</p>



<p>”I want to report them to their schools for online sexual abuse and harassment. I’m thinking about emailing the schools.”

<p>“And when they get confronted by their employers they’re going to get so anxious and start making up excuses to try to cover their asses and we’ll all see the kind of person they are.</p>


<p>“Time to start praying the universities view your work as more important than addressing a sexual harassment accusations report.</p>


<p>”Vassars going to get an email.</p>


<p>”GMU will get an email…”</p>

<p>A similar email also arrived at the Title IX office of George Mason University: “My name is [S.] and I’m not a student nor have I ever been one at George Mason. I’m writing to you today regarding one of your employees, Moe Zilla of criminology, at the university and their sexually harassing behavior towards me online on twitter.” The letter continued: “She has called me a lesbian, and has recommended that I have sexual relationships with women.” 
</p>
<p>By March, S.’s harassment campaign was ramping up yet again. She was back to replying directly to Tan in Twitter posts, calling her a “disgusting criminal” who enjoys “abusing women.</p>

<p>“The story about autistic Asians gang banging white girls to show their dominance as a race,”</p>
<p>“I was once a Quinnipiac student, Lexi is hacking their things and raping students.”</p>
<p>“Bye bitch get fired you abusive piece of shit,” with a photo of S. blowing a kiss.</p>
<p>“I’d go off so hard on these people if I had the chance I’d get arrested for fucking murder or something.”</p>

<p>I’d probably nail one of you guys in the face if I ever met you in public and then get arrested for assault.</p>


<p>I’d much rather go to prison than be civil with any of you. I’d so much rather see you people dead than anywhere else</p>
